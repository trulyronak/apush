##Jamestown 1607

###Overview

Jamestown was the first British colony in America, founded in 1607 by the Virginia Company of England

###Cause
The joint-stock Virginia Company founded the colony looking for gold. 
###Effect
Its charter guaranteed the overseas settlers the same rights that they would get if they stayed in England. This part of the charter was eventually extended to all of the colonies.


##The Establishment of the Colonies

###The South
- First Colony: Jamestown, Virginia
- Maryland: Catholic Haven formed by Lord Baltimore
- Carolina founded in 1670
- George created as buffer colony
- Southern Colonies

- New Netherlands -> New York
- Pennsylvania formed by Penn

##Calvinism-Puritanism

###Overview
1517: Martin Luther nails his 95 Theses -> John Calvin of Geneva founds Calvinism, which becomes the religion of the Puritans. 

King Henry VIII breaks from Catholic Church, wants to keep same customs, but Puritans in England believe they should "Purify" the Anglican Church into Calvinism. A group of Puritans, the Seperatists, break away entirely from the Church -> Form Plymouth
###Effect
Puritans founded the New England and Massachusetts Bay Colonies and dominate Connecticut.

##Ethnic, religious, social diversity in the colonies

###Overview
- Swedes in Deleware
- Germans were 6% of the population, and came fleeing war
	- mostly Lutheran Protestants
	- mostly in Pennsylvania
- Scots-Irish, 7% of population
	- came for tolerant Pennsylvania
	- found that the best land was already taken by the Germans and Quakers
	- pushed out and attacked Indians for land, became first frontiers
	- very rebellious group of people, and were anti-Native American

###Diversity by Colony
- Puritans were the least ethically diverse.
- Middle Colonies were diverse (many different white immigrants)
- South displayed its historic black-and-white composition

##John Winthrop
The Massachusetts Bay Colony's first Governor.  
###Overview

Very religious, propelled Massechusetts as a beacon to humanity and a model, religious society. Made the colony one of the biggest and most influential of the New England Outposts. Made Massachusetts into a fur trading, fishing and primarily, shipbuilding industry powerhouse.

## Roger Williams (Founded Rhode Island in 1635)

###Overview
Popular Salem minister who challenged the Bay Colony's charter and Puritan values.

- Denied authority of civil government to regulate relgious behavior (the fundemental construct of Puritan society)
- Challenged the colony's stealing of land from Indians

###Effect
Kicked out of Massachusetts in 1635, Williams fled to the Rhode Island area in 1636, and built a Baptist church. Established complete freedom of religion, even for Jews and Catholics. Demanded no oaths regarding religous beliefs, no taxes for a state church, and even sheltered the Quakers.

Also gave universal suffrage (though property requirements eventually were added).

Made Rhode Island as the most liberal and advanced of all settlements in the New World and Old World alike.


##William Penn (Founded Pennsylvania in 1681)

###Overview
Quaker Englishman who founded the colony of Pennsylvannia in 1681. Bought land from Indians (as opposed to stealing, like most other colonies) and organized his cities. Had an unusually liberal regime included a representative assembly elected by landowners. There was no tax-supported church, and freedom of religion was granted to all settlers, though England forced Penn to deny Catholics and Jews the right to vote or hold office. There was no military, no restrictions on immigration, and naturalization was an easy process. The Quakers disliked slavery and Pennsylvania promoted a modern atmosphere giving economic opportunity, civil liberty, and religious freedom. 


## John Smith

###Overview
Captain John Smith was an early savior of the Virgina colony. He turned the inital colonists from gold hungry colonists to look for food and start farming.

##John Rolfe

###Overview
Father of the tobacco industry and the economic savior of Virginia. Also husband to Pocahontas.

###Effect
By 1612, Rolfe had perfected methods of raising tobacco, and started selling it to Europe. Soon, the demand became so strong that almost all colonists switched to growing tobacco and began looking for more land. This led to more expansion against Native American land. Also led to higher demand for labor, which was first supplied by Indentured Servants, and eventually (after Bacon's Rebellion), African slaves.


##Bacon's Rebellion 1676

###Overview

Bacon's Rebellion was a rebellion in 1676 led by Nathaniel Bacon.
###Cause
The rebellion consisted of freedmen (ex-indentured servants) who were angry that they didn't get the land that they migrated for. In addition, due to a lack of single women in the colonies, they were unable to find wives.

###Effect
Fearful for another rebellion, the landed gentry of the South (Planter Class) began looking for an alternative source of labor. They settled on Africa, thus sparking the slave trade and the South's dependence on slave labor

##Peter Stuyvesant

###Overview
Peter Stuyvesant was a Dutch Directors-General who attacked the Swedish in New Sweden (Delaware).
###Cause
Angered that the Swedish trespassed on the Dutch preserves, the Dutch sent Peter to take out the Swedish forces in New Sweden (Delaware).
###Effect
The colonists of old New Sweden were absorbed into the New Netherlands, and the colony eventually became Delaware)

## New England Confederation 1643

###Overview
Founded in 1643 by the colonists of the Massachusets Bay Colonies and the Connecticut Colonies.
###Cause
The Confederation was formed during the English Civil War, in order to defend themselves against the Indians, French, and Dutch. Each colony only had two votes, which angered the populous Massachusets Colony. 

###Effect
While it was extremely weak and Puritan exclusive, the Confederation was the first considerable milestone to colonial unity. From 1640-1660, when England went through its Civil War, the colonies operated on autonomy, which resulted in a independent culture in the Americas.  The Confederation was disbanded in the 1660s, when King Charles II took power. (Replaced with Dominion of New England)

##Dominion of New England 1686

###Overview
The Dominion of New England included New England, New York, and East and West Jersey
###Cause
In 1686, royal authority created the Dominion of New England to promote efficiency in the administration of the English Navigation Laws. This was part of an effort by the monarchy to tie the colonies closer to the motherland by restricting trade with only England. The Dominion was lead by Sir Edmund Andros, who heavily taxed the people and enforced the hated Navigation Laws, nearly caused a revolt within the colonies. The Dominion was disbanded after the Glorious Revolution in England of 1689.
###Effect
As a result of these laws, colonists turned to smuggling and colonists began to share similar sentiments against England.


## Great Puritan Migration

###Overview
Most likely a typo for great "english" migration.
- look into that


##The Half-Way Covenant and the Salem Witch Trials 1660s

###Overview
The Salem Witch Trials were trials held across New England settlements prosecuting 'witches', who were actually mostly women from commerical families.

In the mid-seventeenth century, preachers began preaching jermiads, worried by declining religios devotion. In 1662, ministers announced the <b>Half Way Covenant</b>, which was a new form of Church membership that allowed the baptism of non-converted members. 	

As a result of expanding Puritan membership, the link between the elect and the others broke, which further diluted the spiritual purity from the original Puritans. This eventually led to the Puritan Church opening its doors to everyone, led to and end of strict religious purity. Also led to an increase of women in the Puritan congregation, who came to make up the majority of churchgoers. This eventually lead into the Salem Witch trials, where most of the accused women came from Salem's growing market economy and the accusers came from the farming families in Salem. They reflected the widening social gaps of New England and the fear that Puritan Heritage was dying out to Yankee commericalism.

## The Great Awakening (1730s-1740s)

###Cause
In the early 18th century, religion was sagging in the colonies. The Puritans in particular, were fighting against liberal ideas that suggested that not just the 'elect' get to go to heaven. **Arminianism**, the theology preached by Jacobus Arminius, preached that an individual's free will determined a person's eternal fate, and that all humans, not just the elect, could go to heaven if they accepted God's grace. A few Puritan churches accepted this, leading into more emotional packed sermons, also known as the **Great Awakening**.

###Effect
The Awakening's emphasis on direct, emotional spirituality damaged the authority of the older clergy, who had relied on their education for their authority. This lead to many more different churches and schisms in the religion. It also lead to the creation of American colleges like Princeton and Brown and others to promote higher learning and clergy training. Most importantly, the Awakening was the first mass movement of the American people, that united many of the American people.

###<u>Important Preachers</u>
###Jonathan Edwards

####Overview
Ignited the Great Awakening. Believed in salvation through good works and was fairly popular, but was overshadowed by Whitefield 4 years later.

###George Whitefield

####Overview

George Whitefiled was a famous preacher during the Great Awakening, and represented the ideas of great emotional preaching during the time.


## Headright System

###Overview
Law that gave the right to acquire 50 acres of land if you pay the passage of an indentured servant.
###Cause
Virginia and Maryland passed this system in order to make it more favorable to bring in indentured servants to work the land, which would increase each colony's economy.
###Effect
The system greatly benefitted the masters who brought slaves to the New World, and they eventually became the great merchant-planters of the South, also known as the Planter Class. (Washington and many other of the founding fathers belonged to this class).

##  Indentured Servants

###Overview
Indentured Servants were people who boarded ships to America, who voluntarily sold themselves to virtual slavery for a fixed amount of time in exchange for passage to the New World, and (maybe) land after they became free.
###Cause
Due to a "surplus" of men in England and a growing Tobacco industry in America, a demand for labor was sparked.

<b>Why not African Slaves?</b>

Since African slaves were more expensive and morality rates were high in the South (Primarily the Chesapeake), Africans were seen as a bad investment, and so the landowners turned to indentured servants instead.
###Effect
Led to an even more increased reliance on agriculture in the South. Eventually, after Bacon's Rebellion, the planters would turn to African slaves.

##Triangular Trade

###Overview
The trade between New England, Africa, and the West Indies.

New England gave rum, Africa took the rum for slaves, the West Indies gave molasses for the slaves, and the molasses went to New England for more rum.


##Middle Passage

###Overview
The passage where slaves were transported across, in cruel conditions. Africans were mostly sold to Newport, Rhode Island, or Charleston, South Carolina.


##The French and Indian War 1754-1763

###Overview
Started by George Washington in 1754 when he accidentally shot the French Diplomat

###Effects
Led to Britain nearly bankrupting itself, which meant they needed to now tax the colonists. See <a href="#Salutary-Neglect-1714-1763">Salutary Neglect</a> for more information.

##Albany Congress 1754

###Overview
Congress summoned by the British government to (short-term) keep the Iroquois loyal to the British and (long-term) unite the colonies together to create a common defense against the French.

###Effect

Another attempt for colonial unity, 7/13 colonies showed up.


##William Pitt 1757

###Overview
Also known as "The Great Commoner", William Pitt was a leader who in 1757 took power in the London government. Pitt's efforts ultimately resulted in victory in the French and Indian war.

###Effect
See the terms of the Battle of Quebec (Below)
##Battle of Quebec 1759

###Overview
Marked the end of the French and Indian War. 

###The Terms

The end of the war resulted in Spain and England taking all of French territory, and England taking Spain, resulting in England as the dominant power in North America and as the leading naval power in the World.


##Mercantilism

###Overview
The belief that a country's military and political power was measured by its wealth which was measured by the amount of gold or silver a country had. To acquire gold or silver a country needed to **export more than it imported**. Thus, owning colonies were strategic as they could supply raw materials and a guaranteed market to export to.

###Effect
As a result, the London government treated the Americans as tenants, and initially enforced laws like the Navigation Acts of 1650 to keep colonials only trading with Britain. However, the colonies eventually became so prosperous that the British stoppped bothering to enforce these laws as they were profitting so heavily off of colonial trade. However after the French and Indian War, the British treasury went nearly bankrupt, forcing the British to enforce the laws again. This angered the colonials as they had been used to self-government under British **salutary neglect**.


##Salutary Neglect 1714-1763

###Overview
A period of time from 1714-1763 when England didn't enforce many of its laws (Navigation Laws and Taxes). Arguably in effect since 1607.

###Effect
The Americans became increasing self-reliant and resistant to taxes, causing problems after the French and Indian War (1763) when the British needed the colonists to help pay off debt from the war.

##Proclamation of 1763

###Overview
Prohibited settlement in the area beyond the Appalachian moutains.
Issued by the British government in oreder to work out the Indian problem and prevent another revolt like Pontiac's Uprising.

###Effect
Angered Americans who thought they had won that land after winning the French and Indian War and after crushing Pontiac's Uprising, several expanded into prohibitted areas anyways.
 Marked more splitting with British policy by the colonists.

##Acts of 1764 - 1765

###Overview

####Sugar Act (1764)
Increased duty tax on sugar imported form the West Indies.
Offenders of this act and the stamp act were forced to appear in **admirality courts** where juries were not allowed, and defendants were "guilty until proven innocent"

####Quartering Act (1765)

Law that forced the colonials (mostly in New England) to house British troops.

###Stamp Act (1765)
Tax on stamps, mostly effected the wealthy, Samuel Adams incited colonials "No Taxation without representation"
Led to Stamp Act Congress of 1765

###Stamp Act Congress
9 colonies sent representatives, decided on **nonimportation agreements** against British goods. (Common boycott from the colonies against British goods)


##Declatory Act 1766


###Cause
After withdrawing the Stamp Act, Parliament passed the Declatory Act which reaffirmed Parliaments right to bind the colonies in all cases. Effectively stated that the British government would not tield its control over its colonies.

###Effect
Set the stage of a continuing confrontation between the colonists and the British.

##Townshend Acts 1767

###Overview
Passed in 1767 by efforts from Charles Townshend.

###Effect
The Acts added a duty on glass, white lead, paper, paint, and tea. Made the taxes an indirect customs duty. However, the colonists were mostly just angry at being taxed without representation. 

Also, since the tax income was meant to be used to pay the salaries of the royal governors (The Americans had long since been controlling Royal Governors through their salaries) the colonists saw this as another attempt to control them. 

Led to more smuggling and nonimportation agreements (Similar to those passed by the Stamp Act Congress) which lead to the British sending more troops to the colonies to keep law and order. (eventually led to Boston Massacre).



##Samuel Adams

###Overview
Samuel Adams was a political organizer who led many protests against English taxation and ran **The Sons of Liberty**, a British opposition group. Helped to unite against Britain. Without Adams, it is likely that the Revolution we know today would never have existed.

### Committees of Correspondence

####Overview
Organized by Samuel Adams, the first in 1772 Boston. They kept the British opposition alive and gave Adams a network to spread propoganda.

##John Hancock

###Overview
Samuel Adams' financial backer. A <del>trader</del> smuggler, Hancock was angered by British when they began enforcing the Navigation Acts (anti-smuggling) the Stamp Acts (caused him to pay more on imports) and others. He found Adams interesting as he was a great organizer, and Hancock decided to back him and his rebel group **The Sons of Liberty**.



##Boston Massacre 1770

###Overview
In 1770, a clash between 60 townspeople and a squad of 10 redcoats led to 11 casualities. Samuel Adams called on Paul Revere to make an engraving of the incident and Adams circulated these all across the colonies, sparking anger against the British governments.


##Boston Tea Party 1773

###Cause
In 1773, the British East India Company, facing bankruptcy, was given a monopoly of the American tea buisness. The corporation sold tea to the colonies at a cheaper rate than before, even with taxes. This angered John Hancock in particular, who was unable to sell his tea anymore. He and Saumel Adams rallied colonists against this, seeing it as a disguised tax. Thus, on December 16, 1773, colonists attacked tea ships in Boston Harbor and poured out all the tea into the harbor.
###Effect
Resulted in the <a href="#intolerable-acts-of-1774">Intolerable Acts</a>

##Intolerable Acts of 1774

###Overview
After the Boston Tea Party, Parliament responded with these Acts in an attempt to deal with the situation.

Acts: 

- Boston Port Act: Closed the harbor until damages were paid back
	- Restrictions were also placed on local town meetings
- Quartering Act: Gave local authorities power to lodge British soldiers anywhere, even in private homes
- Quebec Act: <a href="#quebec-act">More Information</a>

###Effect
Considered as the massacre of American Liberty. Also led to <a href="#first-continental-congress">The First Continental Congress</a> in 1774. 

##Quebec Act 1774

###Overview
Passed with the **Intolerable Acts of 1774**, the Quebec Act was actually a good law. The law gave the French Canadians the right to Catholicism and the right to keep their old customs and instituions (which didn't allow trial by jury). Additionally, the law gave the province of Quebec the Ohio River as its new Southern boundary.
###Effect
American colonists were angered that the Canadians got land that they had planned to move into, and angered Anti-Catholics.


##First Continental Congress 1774

###Overview
12/13 colonies met to address colonial grievances. Acted as a consultative body to decide what to do about the Intolerable Acts.

###Effect
John and Samuel Adams moved a proposal for American home rule under British direction. The Congress also drew up several papers, including the Declaration of Rights and appeals to other colonies, the king, and the British people.

The biggest action was the creation of <a href="#the-association">The Association</a>


##The Association 1774

###Overview
Called for a complete boycott of British goods. A combination of nonimportation, nonexportation, and nonconsumption. However, this was not a call for independence, instead, the colonists simply wanted to call of the offensive taxation and return to the state of America before the French and Indian War.


##Lexington/Concord 1775

###Overview
In response to the Association, the British commander in Boston sent troops in April 1775 to Lexington and Concord to steal colonial gunpoweder and capture Samuel Adams and John Hancock.

At Lexington, a group of <i>Minute Men</i> tried and failed to stop the British, resulted in 8 dead Americans. However, the British were forced to retreat at Concord, where a large force of Americans dealt 300 casualties to the British.

###Effect
Effectively started the revolutionary war. 

##Bunker Hill 1775

###Overview
The first battle of the Revolutionary War, colonists seized Bunker Hill (Breed's Hill at the time) and mowed down advancing redcoats.

###Effect
The French began to look at the colonists as an actual force, King George abandoned all hope of reconcilliation (Despite the July 1775 **Olive Branch Petition**), and hired thousands of German troops (Hessians) in addition to British troops to fight the war in America. The hiring of German troops shocked the colonists, who felt that the war was a "family matter".

##The Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776)

###Overview
Also known as "Jefferson's explanation of Independence", this document was formal declaration of **Richard Henry Lee**'s resolution.

###Effect
Appealed universally and gave a long list of reasons on why the colonies were leaving, primarily to inform the French that they had nothing to fear in helping the colonies win independence.


##Thomas Paine (Common Sense 1776)

###Overview
British writer who wrote *Common Sense*, an extremely influential pamphlet.

###Contents
- States only derive their powers from the consent of the governed.
- Unless America is independent, they cannot hope for foreign assistance
- Called for creation of a *republic*, where power flowed from the people
- Promoted **citizen virtue**, the concept that a citizen must sacrifice their personal needs for the collective good of a nation

###Effect
As a result of the pamplet, he effectively gave Washington an army by convincing enough people that there was a reason to fight.


##Battle of Saratoga 1777

###Overview
On October 17, 1777, British General John Burgoyne surrendered to American General Horatio Gates
###Cause
Explain this later, its pretty complicated
###Effect
At this point, the French were just waiting for one big victory by the colonists before they sent troops; this battle did that, and allowed Americans to get foreign aid. The victory itself was also an immense morale booster, and revived the faltering colonial cause.


## Yorktown 1781

###Overview
Decisive victory that effectively ended the Revolutionary War. 
###Cause
Cornwallis had retreated into the Chesapeake Bay at Yorktown at one of the few times during the war when the French controlled the seas. Admiral de Grasse covered the seas, General Washington and French General Rochambeau assaulted Cornwallis on land, forcing him to surrender on October 19, 1781.

- The US gets all land from Mississippi (Western boundary) to the Great Lakes (Northern boundary) to Spanish Florida (Southern boundary).
- America holds a share in the fisheries of Newfoundland (angered Canada)
- Congress must recommend state legislatures to return confiscated Loyalist property
- The states must not put any legal obstacles in paying off debt
