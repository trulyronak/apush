## Overview of this site

Here you'll a review of topics in APUSH, based on <b><u>The American Pagent</u></b>, the book I use for APUSH.
This page will be updated throughout the year, and by the end it should be complete. My notes are cause and effect
based, meaning that I won't spend too much time on details, but on why something happened and why it's important.
